Earth Darts (Sp): As a standard action, you can unleash a 
rock dart targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged 
touch attack. This rock dart deals 1d6 points of physical 
damage + 1 point for every two cleric levels you possess 
(this attack is still considered magical for over coming 
DR). You can use this ability a number of times per day 
equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.
